## About The Project

![Home page](src/assets/readMe/home-scrin.png)

The are a lot of movie's search apps nowadays, and mine isn't the best one from technical side, but it's special because that's the project my way in programing starts from.

That's some points you would probably like my site:

1. Positive name if you understand my sence of humor
2. We all starts from something unperfect and this project is a good one to motivate you and don't let you to give up

This project wasn't easy for me but I starter to understand much more deeper how to work with API, learned some new libraries which makes the life of programmer much more easier and understood that I like writing code no matter how much stress it gives to me.

Probably it's not the final version of it, so in near future I'll give you an opportunity to see how my skills are growing.
